# Criteria A: Planning


## Problem definition
The International Baccalaureate (IB) program is a rigorous academic curriculum that emphasizes holistic learning, including the development of creativity, action, and service (CAS) skills. As part of this program, students are required to create a CAS portfolio that documents their participation in extracurricular activities outside of the classroom.
However, the grade 11 IB students at ISAK  have been facing challenges with their CAS portfolio. Many of them do not have proper documentation of their activities and lack photographs and descriptions of the clubs sessions they participated in. This has resulted in more than half of the students having incomplete portfolios.
The CAS portfolio is an important part of the IB program and is used to assess a student's engagement in creative, active, and service-oriented activities. It is designed to help students reflect on their experiences and develop key skills such as collaboration, leadership, and communication.
Without proper documentation, students may find it difficult to demonstrate their involvement in these activities and may receive a lower grade on their CAS portfolio. This can have a negative impact on their overall IB score and future university applications.

## Proposed Solution
To address the challenges faced by the grade 11 IB students at ISAK with their CAS portfolio, I will create a new website, called CasHub, that provides a platform for students to create profiles, add personal information, and make posts about their clubs. With Cashub, each club has a main page that have all the posts made by the users, members of that club, who are responsible for posting updates after each club session with descriptions and photos, and tag each member of the club to ensure that all members will have that activity in their profiles. This approach ensures that students have proper documentation of their extracurricular activities, which is essential for completing their CAS portfolio.
This innovative approach to managing extracurricular activities not only helps students develop better portfolios but also provides an opportunity for clubs to showcase their activities and accomplishments, and also for the clubs and activities faculty leader to make sure that students-lead clubs are holding sessions.
Overall, the creation of Cashub offers an effective solution to the problem, by providing students with a central platform to manage their extracurricular activities and proper documentation of their activities, CasHub helps students showcase their skills and accomplishments while also ensuring student-led clubs are active. 

## Design Statement


### Rationale
To create a comprehensive and effective solution, the primary programming language for the back end will be Python, with the Flask library. Python is a versatile language that can be used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, making it an excellent choice for this project. Python has a supportive community and comprehensive documentation, making it easy to learn and use, which will help in building a reliable solution.

Flask is a lightweight framework that is ideal for building web applications. It is easy to use, flexible, and can be customized to meet specific requirements. Flask provides essential features such as request handling, routing, and template rendering, making it an excellent choice for developing the back end of this solution.

For the front end, the user interface will be created using HTML and CSS. HTML is the standard markup language used for creating web pages, and CSS is used for styling and formatting the pages. The interface will be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a modern and visually appealing layout.

To store the data, I will be using the SQLite database engine. This database engine is optimized for efficiently managing and storing large amounts of data, which makes it a reliable choice for applications that need to handle and scale with growing amounts of data. The SQLite database engine enables the storage of structured data that can be easily queried and analyzed, while also providing data integrity and transaction management features to ensure data accuracy and consistency. This will enable me to create a robust and reliable solution that can handle a significant amount of data while maintaining data accuracy and consistency.


### Success Criteria

1. The website should allow students to create profiles with personal information. 
2. Each club should have a main page that displays all the posts made by its members. 
3. The website should ensure that all activities are properly documented and tagged, which is essential for completing the CAS portfolio. 
4. The website should have a search function to allow users to quickly and easily see all their posts. 
5. The website should have an option to delete posts.
6. The website should have an option that allow users to search for every clubs page and students profile.
